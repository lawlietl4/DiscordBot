# DiscordBot
My discord bot I developed

When making the config.json, the token can be found in the bot's information area under the token piece, you don't need to reveal since they added a copy button
Example of config.json:
{
  "prefix": "{custom character you want the commands to be included with}",
  "token": "{found at dev portal and is the client secret of bot}"
}
